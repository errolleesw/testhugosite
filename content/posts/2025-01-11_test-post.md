2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

You can create links using the following syntax: [link text](URL). For example, [visit GitHub](https://github.com).

## Images

You can add images using the following syntax: `![alt text](image URL)`. For example:

## Code

You can include code snippets by wrapping the code with backticks. For example, `print("Hello, World!")`.

For longer code blocks, use triple backticks:

greet()
```

```

You can create blockquotes using the `>` symbol:

> This is a blockquote.
